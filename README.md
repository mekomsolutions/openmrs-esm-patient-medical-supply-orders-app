# Patient Medical Supply Orders App

This repository adds a new Patient Medical Supply order type to the Patient Chart Order Basket. The users will be able to place Medical Supply Orders and define the quantity and the Quantity Units for the order placed.

## Running this code

```sh
yarn  # to install dependencies
yarn start  # to run the dev server
```

Once it is running, a browser window
should open with the OpenMRS 3 application.

## Integrating it into your application
